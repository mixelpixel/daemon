# daemon
a simple daemon written in C

# purpose
Gain familiarity with developing a system daemon.

# goal
Ideally, I'd like to make something which is cross platform. My goal is to create a system daemon which can accomodate the uploading of media files created by the Zoom meeting application to a private YouTube channel for limited dissemination.
